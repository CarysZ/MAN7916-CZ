10.1177/01492063231220892,Unraveling Mentors’ Positive and Negative Reactions to Protégés’ Taking Charge,Journal of Management,"In the mentoring relationship, protg proactivity is a key facilitator of mentoring support. However, we consider how protg proactivity at work may lower mentors inclination to share knowledge. Drawing on and extending social perception theory and envy subtypes theory, we build a contingent dual-path model to theorize that a proactive protg who takes charge at work may elicit mentor knowledge sharing or hiding through mentor benign or malicious envy, depending on the protgs benevolence. Specifically, mentors are more likely to feel benign envy toward taking-charge and benevolent protgs, enhancing their knowledge sharing. Taking-charge protgs seen as less benevolent may encourage malicious envy in the mentors, leading them to hide knowledge. Findings from a multi-source, two-wave survey of the data of 187 mentorprotg dyads in China (Study 1) and a pre-registered scenario-based experiment of 404 participants in the United States (Study 2) support our predictions. This research advances our knowledge of mentoring, envy, and proactivity, and provides practical implications to enhance the effectiveness of mentorship programs.",2024,Personnel Psychology,Personnel Psychology
10.1177/01492063241268695,Longing for the Past: The Dual Effects of Daily Nostalgia on Employee Performance,Journal of Management,"Employees daily routines (e.g., commutes, lunch breaks, conversations with coworkers or family members) are vital rituals that create order and meaning. However, employees frequently experience changes to how their work and nonwork lives operate, which can generate discontinuity and spark nostalgiaa sentimental longing for the past. In this study, we draw from theory on the dual nature of emotional ambivalence and the literature on emotion regulation to explore countervailing effects of daily nostalgia on employee performance. In a sample of employed adults recruited from a northeastern U.S. universitys alumni database and LinkedIn ( n  109), we used an experience sampling method to capture within-individual variation in nostalgia over 3 weeks. Results of multilevel path analysis showed, on one hand, nostalgia was positively associated with employees cognitive change strategies (e.g., reappraising ones situation), which translated into heightened organizational citizenship behaviors; on the other hand, nostalgia was also positively associated with employees attentional deployment strategies (e.g., distraction), which reduced daily task performance and increased daily counterproductive work behaviors. Unexpectedly, results showed higher trait-level future temporal focus exacerbated the positive effect of nostalgia on attentional deployment. Our results suggest nostalgia embodies a complex mix of emotions that impact individuals response strategies and, ultimately, performance.",2024,Personnel Psychology,Personnel Psychology

Although MVPs are ubiquitous in practice, foundational scholarly work on MVPs is virtually nonexistent. We leverage and build upon the lean start-up literature and the scientific approach to entrepreneurship to develop theory related to the dimensionality, forms, risks, and trade-offs of MVPs. We first define and identify the conceptual boundaries of MVPs and explain the relationship between MVP dimensionality and MVP development decisions. We then specify how MVP risks emerge and how these risks relate to the trade-off decisions that entrepreneurs must grapple with when building and deploying MVPs. We conclude by presenting future research opportunities on this important but previously overlooked phenomenological artifact.",2024,Strategic Management Journal,Strategic Management Journal
10.1177/01492063231224332,Firm Formalization Strategy: The Interaction of Entrepreneurs and Government Officials in the Enforcement of Regulation,Journal of Management,"This research investigates how entrepreneurs in an early-stage market economy decide their level of compliance with formal rules and finds the manner in which they interact with government officials to operate on a continuum of formality. Focusing on the nonmarket strategy approaches entrepreneurs employ to establish relationships with government officials, we build a model that shows how entrepreneurs adopt strategies aligned with their firms level of formality, spanning low to high formality practices. We draw on qualitative interview data from entrepreneurs who exhibit varying levels of compliance with state-provided rules and guidelines. We inductively theorize that deciding the firms level of formality involves strategic interaction approaches with government officials responsible for rule enforcement. Our findings highlight that the interaction strategies entrepreneurs use hinge on the political capital they possess, eliciting the desired response from government officials, and dissuading the officials from enforcing formal rules or imposing sanctions for informality. We offer theoretical and policy implications for future work on the nuances of firm formality and the interaction between entrepreneurs and government officials.",2024,Strategic Management Journal,Strategic Management Journal
10.1177/01492063231225166,Resilience Within Constraints: An Event Oriented Approach to Crisis Response,Journal of Management,"Scholars have started unpacking how individuals, organizations, and communities interact to build a shared capacity for resilience. This research, however, has not yet examined how the institutional environment influences local responses to crises. This is an important omission since crises do not occur in a vacuumdecisions of actors, at one level, constrain or catalyze the resilience responses of communities and the individuals and organizations within them. Furthermore, research on resilience often assumes a relatively static nature of crises, without accounting for the need to revise responses over time. Using an original set of high frequency data on COVID-19 rates in the United States, we investigate the relationship between healthcare decision agency at the county level and the incidence of the pandemic as reflected in the number of COVID cases and death by county. Our results provide robust evidence that higher degrees of decision-making autonomy are associated with lower rates of COVID-19 cases and deaths. That is, a positive relationship exists between decision-making autonomy and higher capacities for resilience. We further show that this relationship is strengthened, the larger and more heterogeneous is the mix of healthcare organizations in a county, and the higher is the need for revising responses given the changing nature of the crisis. Our results emphasize the need for a system approach to the study of resilience, and suggest that, by enabling the customization of responses to local needs and resources, decision-making autonomy enhances the shared capacities for resilience.",2024,Strategic Management Journal,Strategic Management Journal
10.1177/01492063231224370,From Intent to Impact: A Proactive Event Approach for Amplifying Sustainability Across Time,Journal of Management,"We extend event system theory (EST) to conceptualize proactive events and examine how event duration, timing, criticality, and disruption are related to two phases of change associated with an organizationally initiated event. Specifically, we explore the impact of a new sustainability monitoring system on energy consumption using longitudinal archival data from 87 manufacturing units of a Fortune 200 multinational firm. We use a variant of mixed-effects discontinuous growth modeling (DGM) to test EST propositions related to initial and longer-term changes associated with implementing the monitoring system. Results indicate that while the new sustainability monitoring system is effective in reducing within-unit energy consumption on average, there are significant differences in change magnitude between units. The magnitude of change during the pre-post phase was related to between-unit differences in event duration, timing, criticality, and disruption. Longer-term change patterns were related to between-unit differences in managerial criticality behaviors. The results empirically validate several of ESTs core propositions and provide an illustration of how DGM can be modified to study events that vary in onset and duration across entities.",2024,Strategic Management Journal,Strategic Management Journal
10.1177/01492063241271252,Categorizing the Complexity: A Scoping Review of Structures Within Organizations,Journal of Management,"Structures involve a patterned regularity of interactions and frameworks that guide what individuals work on, with whom, and who influences those decisions. A deeper understanding of structures that exist within organizations has begun to emerge and illuminate new forms of structures (over 100 of them) that drive behavior in organizations. In this scoping review, we organize the fragmented insights on structure within organizations into a unifying framework that provides a coherent foundation for the domain by identifying nine topic domains and offering a summary of each (i.e., authority structures, cognitive structures, communication structures, coordination structures, leadership structures, motivational structures, social structures, task structures, and temporal structures). Next, as multiple structures co-occur within organizations, we explore the connections across topic domains, including their combinations. Understanding the separate topic domains and their combinations enables researchers and practitioners to understand why employee behaviors are inconsistent with the behaviors endorsed by a particular structure and better navigate the inherent complexity of structures within organizations. Finally, we outline implications for future work featuring structure combinations as well as emergent areas from the topic domains, such as the potential for change. Given the ubiquity of structures in organizations and their links with a variety of theoretical domains, this articles implications have the potential to benefit a wide range of scholars and managers.",2024,Personnel Psychology,Personnel Psychology
10.1177/01492063241231505,Many Roads to Success: Broadening Our Views of Academic Career Paths and Advice,Journal of Management,"Advice is often given to junior scholars in the field of organization science to ostensibly facilitate their career success. In this commentary, we discuss insights from 19 elite scholars (i.e., Fellows and top journal editors) about the advice they receivedand, often, did not followthroughout their careers. We highlight some of the pitfalls from the current, all-too-common, and often singular advice given to junior scholars while also adding necessary nuance to the requirements to achieve success in our field. We conclude with advice on how to give better advice, thereby more equitably encouraging a new generation of increasingly diverse researchers and future professors.",2024,Personnel Psychology,Personnel Psychology
10.1177/01492063241286494,This Is an Eventful Era: Exploring Event-Oriented Approaches to Organizational Research,Journal of Management,"This special issue explores the transformative role of discrete events in fostering changes at different organizational levels, challenging traditional feature-oriented approaches that focus on stable attributes of individuals, groups, and organizations. Joining the growing body of event-oriented research in diverse settings, the nine published articles evoke a novel theoretical lens (i.e., Event System Theory) to examine a number of discrete events (e.g., everyday change events, organizational downsizing, merger, corporate scandal, technology implementation, the U.S.China trade war, the Black Lives Matter movement). Their findings demonstrate the interesting ways discrete events disrupt routines, prompt adaptation, and impact individual and collective behaviors across various levels within organizations. Our further analysis underscores the importance of adopting an event-oriented perspective for a better understanding of management issues, offering new insights and directions for future research. We hope this special issue provides a robust foundation for integrating event-centric research approaches into organizational theory, emphasizing the need for continued empirical investigation and theoretical refinement in a variety of management research domains, such as strategic management, organizational behavior, entrepreneurship, and human resource management.",2024,Strategic Management Journal,Strategic Management Journal
10.1177/01492063241304376,Coping With Competing Role Expectations: How Do Independent Directors Make Sense of Their Role?,Journal of Management,"How do individual independent directors make sense of their director role? We examine this question in the context of competing expectations among key corporate governance actors during the onboarding process of independent directors. This study explores how independent directors navigate these expectations, which stem from both external change agents, such as government agencies and the media, and internal actors, especially management. Given the inherent ambiguity of their roles, which involve multiple board tasks and lack explicit definition, independent directors often face role conflicts. Our findings reveal that independent directors resolve these conflicts by adopting one of three role orientations: external adaptive, organizational alignment, or provisional balancing. Through this process, they construct their director role by coping with the expectations of key governance actors. This study contributes to the micro-foundations of corporate governance research by shedding light on the individual-level dynamics that shape how independent directors interpret and enact their roles.",2024,Strategic Management Journal,Strategic Management Journal
10.1177/01492063241282762,Tokens or Trailblazers: Identity Construction of Occupants of New Inclusion-Driven Roles,Journal of Management,"New roles birthed by organizational inclusion initiatives present an interesting puzzle. On the one hand, they hold the promise to foster inclusion objectives more directly through their formalization in the organizational structure. On the other hand, they tend to be ambiguous as to what occupants are expected to do and how to reconcile this with existing organizational goals and processes. Therefore, they create a burden for their occupants to create a role identity that legitimizes who they are and what they do. To address this puzzle, we draw on a qualitative study of early occupants of the newly created role of lady officer within the Indian military. We find that their role identity construction involved negotiating an optimal balance between professional and inclusion-informed identities through discursive and embodied identity work. Role occupants identity work initially emphasized elements of their professional identity and subsequently infused elements of departure informed by their views of the role. In doing so, they sought to shape interpretations of the role and craft a sense of role legitimacy. Our key contribution lies in developing an emergent theory of identity construction by occupants of inclusion-focused roles, illustrating their efforts to craft a role identity and a sense of legitimacy for their role and themselves in it amid challenges posed by role ambiguity and by societal and organizational tensions.",2024,Personnel Psychology,Personnel Psychology
10.1177/01492063231225160,A Review of Virtual Impression Management Behaviors and Outcomes,Journal of Management,"Over the past half century, virtual interactions have become a mainstay of contemporary organizations, whether leveraged for formal job interviews or day-to-day communication. Despite this central role, there is a lack of a holistic understanding of how employees make and manage impressions in these virtual contexts. In this article, we review, organize, and evaluate the state of the growing body of cross-disciplinary research on virtual impression management. We develop a guiding theoretical framework that identifies three categories of virtual impression management behavior (verbal, nonverbal, and meta behavior) that meaningfully alter impressions, and the conditions under which these outcomes vary. Through considering this body of research as a whole, we highlight that virtual interactions are quite rich when it comes to creating impressions. By illustrating where virtual impression management research has concentrated thus far, our review enables us to conclude by offering an agenda for future research on virtual impression management.",2024,Personnel Psychology,Personnel Psychology
10.1177/01492063231226136,A Scientific Method for Startups,Journal of Management,"Recent scholarship has sought to develop a scientific method for startups. In this paper we contrast two approaches: lean startup and the theory-based view of startups. The lean startup movement has served an important function in calling for a normative and scientific approach to startups and venture creation. The theory-based view shares this agenda. But there are differences in the underlying theoretical mechanisms and practical prescriptions suggested by each approach. We highlight these differences and their implications for both research and practice. For example, we contrast lean startups emphasis on bounded rationality and entrepreneurcustomer information asymmetry with the theory-based views emphasis on generative rationality and belief asymmetry. The theory-based view focuses on contrarian beliefs, associated problem formulation, and the development of a startup-specific causal logic for experimentation, resource acquisition, and problem solving. The right mix of entrepreneurial actions is contingent and startup-specificguided by a startups unique theory. After pointing out differences between the lean and theory-based view of startups, we discuss opportunities for partial reconciliation, as well as opportunities for empirically comparing perspectives. Overall, we emphasize that a scientific method for startups needs to recognize the importance of contingent, discriminating alignment between entrepreneurial theories and the actions they prescribe (including different types of experimentation and validation, search, and forms of organization).",2024,Strategic Management Journal,Strategic Management Journal
10.1177/01492063241287188,"Mitigating Cognitive Bias to Improve Organizational Decisions: An Integrative Review, Framework, and Research Agenda",Journal of Management,"The detrimental influence of cognitive biases on decision-making and organizational performance is well established in management research. However, less attention has been given to bias mitigation interventions for improving organizational decisions. Drawing from the judgment and decision-making (JDM) literature, this paper offers a clear conceptualization of two approaches that mitigate bias via distinct cognitive mechanismsdebiasing and choice architectureand presents a comprehensive integrative review of interventions tested experimentally within each approach. Observing a lack of comparative studies, we propose a novel framework that lays the foundation for future empirical research in bias mitigation. This framework identifies decision, organizational, and individual-level factors that are proposed to moderate the effectiveness of bias mitigation approaches across different contexts and can guide organizations in selecting the most suitable approach. By bridging JDM and management research, we offer a comprehensive research agenda and guidelines to select the most suitable evidence-based approach for improving decision-making processes and, ultimately, organizational performance.",2024,Personnel Psychology,Personnel Psychology
10.1177/01492063241286493,Old Habits Die Hard: A Review and Assessment of the Threat-Rigidity Literature,Journal of Management,"Since its introduction more than four decades ago, threat-rigidity theory has emerged as a popular managerial theory of threat response used in a wide variety of literature streams. The theory explains that individuals, groups, and organizations revert to familiar responses (i.e., rigidity) in navigating threats, even when doing so may not be ideal. Yet, despite its popularity, fidelity to the theorys assumptions and core arguments have been missing, and development of the theory has been limited. As organizations continue facing new and unique threats (e.g., advancing technologies, economic downturns, supply chain disruptions, global health crises), a review and synthesis of threat-rigidity theory is necessary to drive new knowledge and allow for better understanding of the conditions around and appropriateness of rigidity. Our assessment of the literature reveals several gaps to address, which inform three primary directions for future research. We encourage future scholars to (a) clarify the nature of threats that elicit rigid responses, (b) explore the contextual factors and boundary conditions of the theory, and We provide guidance and sample research questions in each of the proposed directions for scholars to use in future efforts to refine or enhance threat-rigidity theory.",2024,Personnel Psychology,Personnel Psychology
10.1177/01492063241265039,Foreign Director Exit in the Midst of Deteriorating Bilateral Political Relations,Journal of Management,"Amid global geopolitical realism pushing for a race of hegemonic rivalry nowadays, an outflow of global human talents is a pressing organizational concern. Our study draws attention to the underexamined phenomenon of the exit of foreign directors from their host countries during geopolitical tensions. Theorizing from a sensemaking logic, we posit that the deterioration of bilateral political relations serves as an unexpected event that activates foreign directors schemas for dual identity conflict, propelling them to react behaviorally to such identity threats by exiting the board in the host country. In addition, we further posit that the sensemaking process is contingent on how the foreign director draws cues from the embedded social context, including organizational identification, socialization and homophily effect, and socioemotional climate. Our empirical analyses from a sample of 1,014 foreign directors in China from 1999 to 2018 provide strong and robust support for the hypotheses. This study instills important theoretical insights into the transcending impacts of international relations and geopolitics, international governance and foreign directors, and the situated cognitive process of sensemaking regarding the intertwining effects of cognitive schema and social contexts.",2024,Strategic Management Journal,Strategic Management Journal
10.1177/01492063241259424,Paddling Against the Tide: The Micro-Level Strategies Entrepreneurs Employ to Resist Endemic Corruption in Tanzania,Journal of Management,"This paper explores when and how entrepreneurs who operate new organizations in environments where corruption is endemic can resist it. Despite the continued scholarly interest in corruption, anticorruption efforts by micro, small, and medium enterprises have been largely overlooked. Instead, studies have focused on the intraorganizational actions of larger established organizations (local and multinational) without sufficiently considering their interdependence with other actors in their external environments. Given the social exchange nature of corruption, we collected and analyzed data from interviews with Tanzanian entrepreneurs, and theorized about when and how they circumvent or resist corruption. Our findings illuminate the complex relationship between entrepreneurs motivations and capability, and highlight the strategies entrepreneurs use when they seek to resist corruption without compromising their resource needs. Subject to their leverage (i.e., resource endowments and available alternatives), entrepreneurs resist corruption by avoiding powerful focal firms, restructuring their resource dependence in a firm-focused manner, and managing risks. Considering social-relational dynamics, entrepreneurs also find ways to avoid interactions with corrupt agents and to use power strategically (through political tactics, such as co-opting and challenging) that influence agents to act in the entrepreneurs best interests and against corruption.",2024,Strategic Management Journal,Strategic Management Journal
10.1177/01492063241227157,"Customers, Markets, and Five Archetypical Value Creation Logics: A Review of Demand-Side Research in Strategic Management",Journal of Management,"Scholars have examined the role of customer preferences, and demand-side characteristics more generally, in varied core strategy areas like market entry and timing, diversification, positioning, resource reallocation, and firm adaptation, among many others. We review this diverse demand-side literature and develop an empirical classification that identifies five archetypical customer value-creation logics seen in the literature to date. To apply each of these logics, a firm must look downstream with the intent of matching, leveraging, adapting, learning, or shaping customer preferences or market characteristics to create value for customers. For each value-creation logic, we detail the logic itself, how the demand side is characterized, how specific strategic decisions allow for value creation following the logic, literature gaps in the logic, and opportunities for future research. Opportunities include extending the work on existing logics, examining the combined effects of multiple logics, identifying understudied demand-side characteristics, and studying strategy applications for which demand-side attributes have received comparatively little attention to date. These include business models, corporate social responsibility (CSR), corporate governance, and demand-side shocks. Finally, we address implications for managerial practice.",2024,Strategic Management Journal,Strategic Management Journal
10.1177/01492063241228245,Business Models and Lean Startup,Journal of Management,"We explore the intersection between the lean startup methodology and research on business models. We note that both perspectives are anchored on a systematic approach to needs discovery and highlight the importance of value creation (vs. value appropriation). However, while the lean startup is centered on creating value for customers through discovery of product-market fit, research on business models concerns value creation for all stakeholders through establishing product-market-business model fit. We also discuss how the lean startup method informs research on business models and vice versa. We observe that the promise of applying lean startup to business models lies in probing the viability of new business models with an efficient and effective process. We find that business model research, in turn, can contribute to the lean startup methodology by (a) suggesting extensions to the method that derive from the holistic, system-level nature of the business model construct and (b) highlighting a range of specific experimental subprocesses, refinements, and tools that could be applied to refine the customer needs discovery process.",2024,Strategic Management Journal,Strategic Management Journal
10.1177/01492063241282640,Institutional Topography: A Review of Subnational Institutions,Journal of Management,"Research on subnational institutions is largely motivated by the observation that formal and informal institutions within countries are unevenly configured over geographical space. Although diverse, this relatively nascent body of work has yet to explicate firm activity across subnational locales that exhibit institutional dissimilarity and isomorphism with both proximate and distant centers of political-economic power. To characterize firm activity over such spatially continuous institutional landscapes within countries, we synthesize insights from the subnational institutions literature by introducing a topography framework with its characteristic dimensions comprised of (1) polycentricity, (2) elevation, and (3) slope. We discuss theoretical contributions from using this framework to review 92 articles in the period 1999 to 2024 from 24 journals before concluding with directions for future research. This work integrates knowledge on subnational institutions across management sub-fields, including, but not limited to, international business, strategic management, and entrepreneurship.",2024,Strategic Management Journal,Strategic Management Journal
10.1177/01492063231226250,Peer Response to Regulatory Enforcement: Lobbying by Non-Sanctioned Firms,Journal of Management,"Government agencies rely on general deterrence to protect the public. Firms utilize lobbying for influence and information purposes. This paper explores the intersection of general deterrence and lobbying by firms while investigating whether general deterrence efforts of regulators are met with a lobbying response. Specifically, we propose that following a competitor firm being sanctioned, the non-sanctioned peer firms will increase their amount of lobbying targeted at the sanctioning agency, and the key drivers of these increases in targeted lobbying will be penalty severity, concerns over likely reputational damage, and value alignment. We test our hypotheses using U.S. Environmental Protection Agency violations as a context, and they largely receive support.",2024,Strategic Management Journal,Strategic Management Journal
