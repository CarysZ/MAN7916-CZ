MAN 7916 - Assignment 3

Text collection and construct selection
    The texts collected were job advertisements from LinkedIn for full-time positions. These job ads were chosen because they reflect company culture, job requirements, and employee expectations.
    The constructs selected are "Need to work irregular hours" and "Value employee well-being". 
    "Need to work irregular hours" is a manifest variable that helps to identify whether the job requires employees to work outside standard business hours, which can impact work-life balance.
    "Value employee well-being" is a variable that needs coder interpretation to assess the extent to which the job ad conveys whether the comapny is committed to supporting the physical, emotional, and mental health of its employees. 
    It can be interesting and meaningful to explore whether the companies that imply a value on employee well-being might contradict themselves by demanding work outside normal hours which signals a lack of respect for work-life balance.

The process followed to develop the codebook and coding form
    I followed the steps decribed in Chapter 5 of Neunendorf's textbook to develop the codebook and coding form.
    First, I looked through some of the job ads and see which elements might be interesting to look at. 
    Then I had a call with a friend to train her as a coder and develop the codebook. Coder training include how to derive the wanted information from the job ads and about the mutual exclusive categories. 
    The major challenge we went through was confirming the categories. "Need to work irregular hours", as the manifest variable, is more obvious because most ads either mention overtime or not. We decides to include another category of vaguely implication because sometimes companies would say flexible instead or mention business trip. "Value employee well-being" is more vague and thus we find it hard to confirm the exhaustive categories. We try to resolve the challenge by practicing coding two pieces of text together. We went back and forth between using a nominal scale and an interval scale. Eventually, we settled on using a five-point likert scale. 
    Lastly, we coded the rest texts independently based on the codebook. I was assigned Coder 1 and my friend was assigned Coder 2. Our interrater reliability was 0.845. 

How I would proceed if I were going to continue with the content analysis for a full sample
    What I would do differently is to collect more texts to pilot and include more coders in discussions and trainings so that variables and coding categories can be further refined. I will also need to conduct intercoder reliability checks more often to identify and resolve ambiguities in the codebook. 
    What I would do the same is that I will continue to train coders to ensure they understand the coding process and categories, especially the background knowledge regarding mutual exclusiveness and exhaustive categories. 
    Providing detailed coder training helps to make more accurate decisions in setting the categories and helps maintain interrater reliability. Detailed training and regular reliability checks will allow for consistent coding, even when we need to bring on new coders to the team.
